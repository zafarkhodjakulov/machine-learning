    "### **Logistic Regression: Predicting Heart Disease**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective:\n",
    "Your task is to build a **Logistic Regression** model to predict whether a person has heart disease based on their medical and demographic information. This homework will help you understand how Logistic Regression is used for binary classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset:\n",
    "Use the **Heart Disease dataset**, which contains information about patients' health parameters and whether they have heart disease.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset Overview:\n",
    "The dataset contains the following key features:\n",
    "- **Age**: Age of the person (in years).\n",
    "- **Sex**: Gender (1 = male, 0 = female).\n",
    "- **CP**: Chest pain type (categorical: 0, 1, 2, 3).\n",
    "- **Trestbps**: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg).\n",
    "- **Chol**: Serum cholesterol (in mg/dL).\n",
    "- **FBS**: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dL (1 = true, 0 = false).\n",
    "- **Restecg**: Resting electrocardiographic results (0, 1, 2).\n",
    "- **Thalach**: Maximum heart rate achieved.\n",
    "- **Exang**: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no).\n",
    "- **Oldpeak**: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.\n",
    "- **Slope**: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (categorical: 0, 1, 2).\n",
    "- **CA**: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (0â€“3).\n",
    "- **Thal**: Thalassemia (categorical: 0, 1, 2, 3).\n",
    "- **Target**: **1** if the person has heart disease, **0** otherwise (binary target variable).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps to Complete:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Loading and Exploration**\n",
    "   - Load the dataset using `pandas`.\n",
    "   - Explore the data:\n",
    "     - Display the first few rows and column information.\n",
    "     - Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.\n",
    "     - Understand the distribution of each feature using histograms and box plots.\n",
    "     - Visualize the correlation between features and the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Preprocessing**\n",
    "   - Convert categorical variables into numerical variables using one-hot encoding (e.g., `CP`, `Slope`, `Thal`).\n",
    "   - Scale the features using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler to improve the model's performance.\n",
    "   - Split the dataset into training and test sets (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Building**\n",
    "   - Train a Logistic Regression model using `LogisticRegression` from `sklearn.linear_model`.\n",
    "   - Use different solvers (e.g., `liblinear`, `lbfgs`) and experiment with regularization techniques (`l1`, `l2` penalties).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Evaluation**\n",
    "   - Evaluate the model's performance on the test set using:\n",
    "     - **Accuracy Score**\n",
    "     - **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**\n",
    "     - **Confusion Matrix**\n",
    "     - **ROC Curve and AUC Score**\n",
    "   - Interpret the coefficients of the logistic regression model to understand the influence of each feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Feature Importance**\n",
    "   - Perform feature selection by analyzing p-values or using techniques like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE).\n",
    "   - Retrain the model with the most important features and compare performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Prediction**\n",
    "   - Predict whether a hypothetical patient with specific characteristics (provided in the problem) has heart disease.\n",
    "   - Justify the prediction based on the model's coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bonus Challenges (Optional):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hyperparameter Tuning**\n",
    "   - Use `GridSearchCV` or `RandomizedSearchCV` to find the best combination of hyperparameters for the Logistic Regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multiclass Classification**\n",
    "   - Extend the task by using a dataset where the target variable has more than two classes (e.g., predicting chest pain types instead of heart disease).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Comparison with Other Models**\n",
    "   - Compare Logistic Regression's performance with other classification algorithms like:\n",
    "     - Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n",
    "     - Random Forest\n",
    "     - k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Imbalanced Dataset Handling**\n",
    "   - Introduce imbalance in the dataset (e.g., reduce the number of samples for the target = 1 class) and apply techniques like:\n",
    "     - Oversampling using SMOTE.\n",
    "     - Class weighting in the Logistic Regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deliverables:\n",
    "- A Python script or Jupyter Notebook containing:\n",
    "  - Code for loading, preprocessing, and visualizing the dataset.\n",
    "  - Implementation of Logistic Regression with evaluation results.\n",
    "  - Plots (e.g., ROC curve, confusion matrix) and performance metrics.\n",
    "- A brief report addressing:\n",
    "  - What factors were most predictive of heart disease?\n",
    "  - How did hyperparameter tuning and feature selection impact the model?\n",
    "  - Insights into the model's strengths and limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Useful Hints:\n",
    "- Use `seaborn` and `matplotlib` for data visualization.\n",
    "- Use `sklearn.metrics` for model evaluation metrics.\n",
    "- Start with a simple logistic regression model and progressively enhance it."
