    "### **Support Vector Machines: Classifying Handwritten Digits**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective:\n",
    "Your task is to build a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier to recognize handwritten digits from the famous **Digits dataset**. This homework will help you understand how SVM works for multi-class classification and how kernel tricks can improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset:\n",
    "Use the **Digits dataset** from `sklearn.datasets`. It contains 8x8 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0–9), represented as feature vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps to Complete:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load the Dataset**\n",
    "   - Import the `load_digits` dataset from `sklearn.datasets`.\n",
    "   - Load the features (`data`) and labels (`target`).\n",
    "   - Display the shape of the data and a few sample images using `matplotlib`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Exploration**\n",
    "   - Explore the dataset:\n",
    "     - How many samples and features are there?\n",
    "     - What is the distribution of the target classes (0–9)?\n",
    "   - Plot a few example digits with their corresponding labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Splitting**\n",
    "   - Split the dataset into training (80%) and test (20%) sets using `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection`.\n",
    "   - Standardize the feature values using `StandardScaler`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Build an SVM Classifier**\n",
    "   - Train an SVM classifier using `SVC` from `sklearn.svm` with:\n",
    "     - **Linear kernel**.\n",
    "   - Evaluate the model on the test set using:\n",
    "     - **Accuracy Score**.\n",
    "     - **Confusion Matrix**.\n",
    "     - **Classification Report** (precision, recall, F1-score).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Experiment with Kernels**\n",
    "   - Train and evaluate SVM classifiers with different kernels:\n",
    "     - **Polynomial kernel** (`kernel='poly'`).\n",
    "     - **Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel** (`kernel='rbf'`).\n",
    "   - Compare their performance (accuracy, F1-score, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**\n",
    "   - Use `GridSearchCV` to find the best values for SVM hyperparameters, such as:\n",
    "     - `C`: Regularization parameter.\n",
    "     - `gamma`: Kernel coefficient for RBF.\n",
    "     - `degree`: Polynomial kernel degree.\n",
    "   - Report the best hyperparameters and the resulting model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Visualization**\n",
    "   - Plot a confusion matrix for the best model.\n",
    "   - Use `PCA` or `t-SNE` to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space to 2D or 3D and visualize the data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bonus Challenges (Optional):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Feature Importance**\n",
    "   - Analyze the support vectors and discuss their role in defining the decision boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Custom Kernel**\n",
    "   - Implement a custom kernel function and train the SVM with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Comparison with Other Models**\n",
    "   - Compare the performance of SVM with another classifier, such as:\n",
    "     - **Logistic Regression**.\n",
    "     - **Random Forest**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Real-World Application**\n",
    "   - Extend the task to a larger dataset, such as **MNIST** (available through `tensorflow` or `keras.datasets`), and train an SVM on a subset of the data (e.g., 5,000 samples).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deliverables:\n",
    "- A Python script or Jupyter Notebook containing:\n",
    "  - Code for loading, exploring, and preprocessing the dataset.\n",
    "  - Implementation of SVM with different kernels and hyperparameters.\n",
    "  - Evaluation results and visualizations.\n",
    "- A brief report discussing:\n",
    "  - How well the SVM performed with different kernels.\n",
    "  - The impact of hyperparameter tuning on model performance.\n",
    "  - Observations about the dataset and the classification task.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Useful Hints:\n",
    "- Use `seaborn` for advanced visualizations (e.g., heatmaps for confusion matrix).\n",
    "- Remember to scale the data before training the SVM for better results.\n",
    "- For hyperparameter tuning, set `verbose=2` in `GridSearchCV` to track the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Learning Goals:\n",
    "- Understand how SVM handles multi-class classification.\n",
    "- Learn the impact of different kernels on SVM performance.\n",
    "- Develop skills in hyperparameter tuning and result interpretation.\n",
    "- Explore the role of support vectors and decision boundaries in SVM."
