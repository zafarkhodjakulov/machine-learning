    "### **Homework: Regularization in Machine Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective:\n",
    "The objective of this homework is to understand the concept of **regularization** in machine learning by applying **Ridge Regression** and **Lasso Regression** to a real-world dataset. You will explore how regularization techniques can reduce overfitting and improve the generalization of models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset:\n",
    "Use the **California Housing Dataset**: `data/california_housing.csv`. The dataset contains housing data for various neighborhoods in California.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset Overview:\n",
    "Key features:\n",
    "- **MedInc**: Median income in the neighborhood.\n",
    "- **HouseAge**: Median age of the houses in the neighborhood.\n",
    "- **AveRooms**: Average number of rooms per household.\n",
    "- **AveBedrms**: Average number of bedrooms per household.\n",
    "- **Population**: Total population in the neighborhood.\n",
    "- **AveOccup**: Average number of people per household.\n",
    "- **Latitude**: Latitude of the neighborhood.\n",
    "- **Longitude**: Longitude of the neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Target variable:\n",
    "- **MedHouseVal**: Median house value for the neighborhood (in $100,000s).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps to Complete:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load the Dataset**\n",
    "   - Load the California Housing dataset.\n",
    "   - Convert the dataset into a pandas DataFrame for easier handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Exploration**\n",
    "   - Display the first few rows of the dataset.\n",
    "   - Check for missing values and handle them if necessary.\n",
    "   - Explore feature correlations with the target variable (`MedHouseVal`) using a heatmap or scatter plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Preprocessing**\n",
    "   - Split the data into training and test sets (80% train, 20% test) using `train_test_split`.\n",
    "   - Standardize the features using `StandardScaler` to ensure all features are on the same scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Baseline Model**\n",
    "   - Fit a simple **Linear Regression** model to the training data.\n",
    "   - Evaluate its performance on the test set using:\n",
    "     - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**\n",
    "     - **R-squared (R²)**\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Ridge Regression**\n",
    "   - Apply **Ridge Regression** with different values of the regularization parameter (`alpha`).\n",
    "   - Use cross-validation to find the optimal `alpha`.\n",
    "   - Plot the model coefficients as a function of `alpha`.\n",
    "   - Evaluate the Ridge Regression model and compare it to the baseline model.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Lasso Regression**\n",
    "   - Apply **Lasso Regression** with different values of `alpha`.\n",
    "   - Use cross-validation to find the optimal `alpha`.\n",
    "   - Plot the model coefficients as a function of `alpha`.\n",
    "   - Evaluate the Lasso Regression model and compare it to the baseline and Ridge models.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Model Comparison**\n",
    "   - Compare the performance of Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression in terms of:\n",
    "     - MSE\n",
    "     - R²\n",
    "     - Number of non-zero coefficients in each model (for Lasso).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Insights**\n",
    "   - Discuss the impact of regularization on model performance and feature selection.\n",
    "   - Reflect on how Ridge and Lasso handle overfitting differently.\n",
    "   - Identify the most important features for predicting house prices based on the Lasso model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bonus Challenges (Optional):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ElasticNet Regularization**\n",
    "   - Apply **ElasticNet**, which combines Ridge and Lasso regularization, and tune the `l1_ratio` parameter.\n",
    "   - Compare its performance with Ridge and Lasso.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Real-World Dataset**\n",
    "   - Use a different dataset (e.g., a Kaggle dataset) and repeat the analysis to gain more experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deliverables:\n",
    "- A Python script or Jupyter Notebook containing:\n",
    "  - Data exploration, preprocessing, and model implementation.\n",
    "  - Visualizations of model coefficients and performance metrics.\n",
    "  - Comparison of models and discussion of results.\n",
    "- A brief report discussing:\n",
    "  - The impact of regularization on model performance.\n",
    "  - How Ridge and Lasso handle overfitting.\n",
    "  - Insights into feature importance and model interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Useful Hints:\n",
    "- Use `GridSearchCV` or `cross_val_score` to tune hyperparameters.\n",
    "- Regularization parameters (`alpha`) should be explored over a range of values (e.g., logarithmic scale)."
