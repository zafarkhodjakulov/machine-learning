    "### **Random Forest: Predicting Wine Quality**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective:\n",
    "Your task is to build a **Random Forest** model to predict the quality of wine based on its physicochemical properties. This homework will help you understand how Random Forest works for regression tasks and evaluate its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset:\n",
    "Use the **Wine Quality dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains information on the physicochemical properties of wine and a target variable for wine quality, rated on a scale of 0 to 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can download it from [Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality). Alternatively, it's also available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset Overview:\n",
    "Key features:\n",
    "- **Fixed acidity**\n",
    "- **Volatile acidity**\n",
    "- **Citric acid**\n",
    "- **Residual sugar**\n",
    "- **Chlorides**\n",
    "- **Free sulfur dioxide**\n",
    "- **Total sulfur dioxide**\n",
    "- **Density**\n",
    "- **pH**\n",
    "- **Sulphates**\n",
    "- **Alcohol**\n",
    "\n",
    "Target variable:\n",
    "- **Quality**: Integer value (0â€“10) representing wine quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps to Complete:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Loading and Exploration**\n",
    "   - Load the dataset using `pandas`.\n",
    "   - Display the first few rows to understand the data structure.\n",
    "   - Check for missing values and handle them if necessary.\n",
    "   - Explore the distribution of each feature using histograms.\n",
    "   - Analyze the correlation between features and the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Preprocessing**\n",
    "   - Standardize the features using `StandardScaler` or `MinMaxScaler`.\n",
    "   - Split the data into training (80%) and test (20%) sets using `train_test_split`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Train a Random Forest Regressor**\n",
    "   - Train a Random Forest model using `RandomForestRegressor` from `sklearn.ensemble`.\n",
    "   - Use the default hyperparameters initially.\n",
    "   - Evaluate the model on the test set using:\n",
    "     - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**.\n",
    "     - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.\n",
    "     - **R-squared score**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Feature Importance**\n",
    "   - Extract feature importance from the trained model.\n",
    "   - Plot the feature importance using a bar chart.\n",
    "   - Identify which features are most significant for predicting wine quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**\n",
    "   - Use `GridSearchCV` or `RandomizedSearchCV` to optimize key hyperparameters:\n",
    "     - `n_estimators` (number of trees).\n",
    "     - `max_depth` (maximum depth of the trees).\n",
    "     - `min_samples_split` and `min_samples_leaf`.\n",
    "     - `max_features`.\n",
    "   - Compare the performance of the tuned model to the default model.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Insights**\n",
    "   - Analyze how well the model predicts wine quality.\n",
    "   - Discuss any challenges in predicting this target variable (e.g., subjective nature of wine quality ratings, potential overfitting, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bonus Challenges (Optional):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Classification Task**\n",
    "   - Convert the problem into a classification task by grouping the wine quality ratings into categories (e.g., `Low`, `Medium`, `High`).\n",
    "   - Train a `RandomForestClassifier` instead of a regressor and evaluate the model using classification metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Comparison with Other Models**\n",
    "   - Compare the Random Forest's performance with:\n",
    "     - **Linear Regression** for regression.\n",
    "     - **Logistic Regression** for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Real-World Interpretation**\n",
    "   - Discuss how the most important features (e.g., alcohol, acidity) affect wine quality in practical terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Advanced Visualization**\n",
    "   - Use **Partial Dependence Plots (PDP)** or **SHAP** to visualize the relationship between features and predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deliverables:\n",
    "- A Python script or Jupyter Notebook containing:\n",
    "  - Code for loading, exploring, and preprocessing the dataset.\n",
    "  - Implementation of Random Forest with evaluation metrics.\n",
    "  - Plots for feature importance and evaluation results.\n",
    "- A brief report discussing:\n",
    "  - The key insights from the dataset.\n",
    "  - The importance of various features.\n",
    "  - The impact of hyperparameter tuning on model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Useful Hints:\n",
    "- Use `seaborn` and `matplotlib` for visualizations.\n",
    "- For hyperparameter tuning, set `n_jobs=-1` to utilize all CPU cores.\n",
    "- Random Forest works well without scaling, but scaling can improve interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Learning Goals:\n",
    "- Understand how Random Forest handles regression tasks.\n",
    "- Learn the importance of hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "- Gain insights into feature importance and how it aids interpretability.\n",
    "- Experience the flexibility of Random Forest for both regression and classification."
