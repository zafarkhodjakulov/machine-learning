    "## **Multiple Linear Regression: Predicting House Prices**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to build a **Multiple Linear Regression** model to predict the price of a house based on various features such as its area, the number of bedrooms, and other amenities. This homework will enhance your understanding of how to handle multiple features in regression and how to evaluate a model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You are provided a dataset with the following columns:\n",
    "1. **price**: The price of the house (target variable).\n",
    "2. **area**: The area of the house in square feet.\n",
    "3. **bedrooms**: The number of bedrooms.\n",
    "4. **bathrooms**: The number of bathrooms.\n",
    "5. **stories**: The number of stories the house has.\n",
    "6. **mainroad**: Whether the house is on a main road (yes/no).\n",
    "7. **guestroom**: Whether the house has a guestroom (yes/no).\n",
    "8. **basement**: Whether the house has a basement (yes/no).\n",
    "9. **hotwaterheating**: Whether the house has hot water heating (yes/no).\n",
    "10. **airconditioning**: Whether the house has air conditioning (yes/no).\n",
    "11. **parking**: The number of parking spaces.\n",
    "12. **prefarea**: Whether the house is in a preferred area (yes/no).\n",
    "13. **furnishingstatus**: The furnishing status of the house (furnished, semi-furnished, unfurnished).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps to Complete:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Data Loading and Preprocessing**\n",
    "1. **Load the dataset**:\n",
    "   - Read the dataset using `pandas`.\n",
    "   - Display the first few rows to understand the structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Handle categorical variables**:\n",
    "   - Convert binary categorical variables (e.g., `mainroad`, `guestroom`, etc.) to numerical values (1 for \"yes\" and 0 for \"no\").\n",
    "   - For multi-class categorical variables like `furnishingstatus`, use one-hot encoding or dummy variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Check for missing values**:\n",
    "   - Handle missing values by either imputing (e.g., mean or median) or dropping rows/columns as appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Feature scaling**:\n",
    "   - Scale numerical features like `area`, `price`, and `parking` to ensure all variables are on a similar scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Build the Multiple Linear Regression Model**\n",
    "1. **Split the dataset**:\n",
    "   - Divide the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model implementation**:\n",
    "   - Use **Scikit-learn** to fit a Multiple Linear Regression model:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Fit the model using training data and extract the coefficients for each feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Optional: Manual Implementation**:\n",
    "   - Use the **Normal Equation** for manual implementation:\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\beta = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Model Evaluation**\n",
    "1. **Predictions**:\n",
    "   - Use the model to predict the house prices on the test dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Evaluation Metrics**:\n",
    "   - Calculate performance metrics:\n",
    "     - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**\n",
    "     - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**\n",
    "     - **RÂ² Score**\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interpretation**:\n",
    "   - Discuss the significance of coefficients. For example, how much does the price increase for each additional square foot of area or for houses in preferred areas?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Visualization**\n",
    "1. **Correlation Matrix**:\n",
    "   - Plot a heatmap to show the correlation between features and the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Predictions vs. Actuals**:\n",
    "   - Create a scatter plot comparing predicted prices with actual prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Predictions**\n",
    "1. Use the model to predict the price of a house with the following features:\n",
    "   - **area**: 2400 sq. ft.\n",
    "   - **bedrooms**: 4\n",
    "   - **bathrooms**: 3\n",
    "   - **stories**: 2\n",
    "   - **mainroad**: yes\n",
    "   - **guestroom**: no\n",
    "   - **basement**: yes\n",
    "   - **hotwaterheating**: no\n",
    "   - **airconditioning**: yes\n",
    "   - **parking**: 2\n",
    "   - **prefarea**: yes\n",
    "   - **furnishingstatus**: semi-furnished\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deliverables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A Python script or Jupyter Notebook containing:\n",
    "   - Data preprocessing and feature engineering.\n",
    "   - Implementation of Multiple Linear Regression.\n",
    "   - Model evaluation and interpretation.\n",
    "   - Visualizations of correlations and predictions.\n",
    "2. A brief report discussing:\n",
    "   - The impact of different features on house prices.\n",
    "   - Limitations of the model (e.g., assumptions of linearity or multicollinearity issues)."
