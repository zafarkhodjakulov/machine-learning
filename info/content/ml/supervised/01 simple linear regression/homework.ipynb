    "## **Simple Linear Regression: Predicting House Prices**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to build a **Linear Regression** model to predict the **price of a house** based on its size. This exercise will help you understand the relationship between variables and how to apply Linear Regression for real-world prediction tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You will work with a dataset `data/housing.csv` containing the following columns:\n",
    "- **price**: The price of the house in dollars.\n",
    "- **area**: The size of the house in square feet.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps to Complete:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Loading and Exploration**  \n",
    "   - Visualize the relationship between **Size** and **Price** using a scatter plot.\n",
    "   - Check for outliers, missing values, or anomalies in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Build a Linear Regression Model**  \n",
    "   - Split the dataset into **training** and **test sets** (80% training, 20% testing).\n",
    "   - Implement a **Simple Linear Regression** model using:\n",
    "     - **Manual Calculation** (Optional): Derive the slope $m$ and intercept $b$ using the formulas for linear regression:\n",
    "       $$\n",
    "       m = \\frac{\\sum{(x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}}{\\sum{(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}}, \\quad b = \\bar{y} - m\\bar{x}\n",
    "       $$\n",
    "     - **Scikit-learn**: Use `LinearRegression` from `sklearn.linear_model` to fit the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Evaluation**  \n",
    "   - Predict the test set house prices using the model.\n",
    "   - Evaluate the model’s performance using:\n",
    "     - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**\n",
    "     - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**\n",
    "     - **R² Score**\n",
    "   - Interpret the slope ($m$) and intercept ($b$) of the linear equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Visualization**  \n",
    "   - Plot the **regression line** over the scatter plot of **area** vs. **price**.\n",
    "   - Visualize the residuals (errors) between the actual and predicted house prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Prediction**  \n",
    "   - Use the trained model to predict the price of a house with a size of 1,000 square feet.\n",
    "   - Discuss whether the prediction seems reasonable based on the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deliverables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A Python script or Jupyter Notebook containing:\n",
    "  - Data loading, preprocessing, and visualization.\n",
    "  - Implementation of Simple Linear Regression.\n",
    "  - Model evaluation and insights.\n",
    "  - Predictions and their interpretation.\n",
    "- A brief report discussing:\n",
    "  - The relationship between **Size** and **Price**.\n",
    "  - The limitations of using Linear Regression for this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Useful Hints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `numpy` for manual calculations and matrix operations.\n",
    "- Use `pandas` for data manipulation and `matplotlib`/`seaborn` for visualizations.\n",
    "- Experiment with data transformations (e.g., log or scaling) to improve results."
