    "### **Introduction to Machine Learning: Exploring a Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective:\n",
    "The goal of this homework is to familiarize yourself with the steps involved in a typical machine learning project: **data loading, exploration, cleaning, and basic visualization**. You'll work with a real-world dataset to understand its structure, identify patterns, and prepare it for future machine learning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset:\n",
    "Use the **Titanic Dataset**, a classic dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) or directly from the `seaborn` library (`sns.load_dataset('titanic')`). This dataset includes information about passengers on the Titanic, such as their demographics, ticket class, and survival status.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps to Complete:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understand the Dataset**\n",
    "   - Load the dataset using `pandas` or `seaborn`.\n",
    "   - Display the first few rows of the dataset.\n",
    "   - Check the dataset’s structure: number of rows, columns, and data types.\n",
    "   - Explore the features (columns): What does each column represent? Which ones are numerical, categorical, or mixed?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Summary Statistics**\n",
    "   - Calculate basic statistics (mean, median, mode, etc.) for numerical columns.\n",
    "   - Count unique values in categorical columns (e.g., `Sex`, `Embarked`).\n",
    "   - Identify any relationships between features, e.g., using `groupby` or pivot tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Missing Data Analysis**\n",
    "   - Check for missing values in the dataset.\n",
    "   - Identify which features have the most missing values.\n",
    "   - Suggest strategies to handle missing data (e.g., drop rows/columns, impute values).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Visualization**\n",
    "   - Create visualizations to understand the data better:\n",
    "     - A histogram or box plot of **Age** to analyze its distribution.\n",
    "     - A bar chart of **Sex** to show the male/female ratio.\n",
    "     - A pie chart or bar plot showing the distribution of **Survived** (target variable).\n",
    "     - Compare survival rates based on **Pclass**, **Sex**, or **Embarked** using grouped bar plots or heatmaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Data Cleaning**\n",
    "   - Perform basic data cleaning:\n",
    "     - Remove duplicate rows (if any).\n",
    "     - Fill missing values for selected features (e.g., fill `Age` with the median).\n",
    "     - Encode categorical variables (e.g., convert `Sex` to 0/1).\n",
    "   - Discuss how your cleaning steps could affect machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Basic Insights**\n",
    "   - Answer exploratory questions based on the dataset, such as:\n",
    "     - What percentage of passengers survived?\n",
    "     - Did passengers in higher ticket classes (Pclass) have a higher survival rate?\n",
    "     - Did age or gender influence survival?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bonus Challenges (Optional):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Feature Engineering**\n",
    "   - Create new features from the existing ones, such as:\n",
    "     - Family size (`SibSp + Parch`).\n",
    "     - A binary feature for whether a passenger was traveling alone.\n",
    "   - Discuss how these features might help in future machine learning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Advanced Visualizations**\n",
    "   - Use pair plots (`sns.pairplot`) to explore relationships between numerical variables.\n",
    "   - Create a correlation heatmap for numerical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mini Predictive Task**\n",
    "   - Identify potential target variables (e.g., `Survived`) and discuss what features might be useful for predicting them.\n",
    "   - Create a simple decision rule (not a model) to predict survival based on your observations, such as:\n",
    "     - “If `Pclass == 1` and `Sex == female`, then `Survived = 1`, else `Survived = 0`.”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deliverables:\n",
    "- A Python script or Jupyter Notebook containing:\n",
    "  - Data loading, exploration, and cleaning steps.\n",
    "  - Visualizations with clear labels and titles.\n",
    "  - Answers to the exploratory questions.\n",
    "  - Suggestions for handling missing data and feature engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Useful Hints:\n",
    "- Use libraries like `pandas` for data manipulation and `matplotlib`/`seaborn` for visualization.\n",
    "- Save your cleaned dataset for use in future lessons when you apply machine learning algorithms."
