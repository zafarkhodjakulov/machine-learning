THE FROGS AND THE OX

An Ox came down to a reedy pool to drink. As he splashed heavily
into the water, he crushed a young Frog into the mud. The old
Frog soon missed the little one and asked his brothers and
sisters what had become of him.

"A _great big_ monster," said one of them, "stepped on little
brother with one of his huge feet!"
"Big, was he!" said the old Frog, puffing herself up. "Was he as
big as this?"
"Oh, _much_ bigger!" they cried.

The Frog puffed up still more.
"He could not have been bigger than this," she said. But the
little Frogs all declared that the monster was _much, much_
bigger and the old Frog kept puffing herself out more and more
until, all at once, she burst.

_Do not attempt the impossible._
