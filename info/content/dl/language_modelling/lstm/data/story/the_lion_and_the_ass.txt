THE LION AND THE ASS

A Lion and an Ass agreed to go hunting together. In their search
for game the hunters saw a number of Wild Goats run into a cave,
and laid plans to catch them. The Ass was to go into the cave and
drive the Goats out, while the Lion would stand at the entrance
to strike them down.

The plan worked beautifully. The Ass made such a frightful din in
the cave, kicking and braying with all his might, that the Goats
came running out in a panic of fear, only to fall victim to the
Lion.

The Ass came proudly out of the cave.

"Did you see how I made them run?" he said.

"Yes, indeed," answered the Lion, "and if I had not known you and
your kind I should certainly have run, too."
