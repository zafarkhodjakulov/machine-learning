THE WOLF AND THE SHEPHERD

A Wolf, lurking near the Shepherd's hut, saw the Shepherd and his
family feasting on a roasted lamb.

"Aha!" he muttered. "What a great shouting and running about
there would have been, had they caught me at just the very thing
they are doing with so much enjoyment!"

_Men often condemn others for what they see no wrong in doing
themselves._
