# makemore

`makemore` is a character-level language model project created by **Andrej Karpathy**. It demonstrates how to train neural networks to generate text, such as names, by predicting the next character in a sequence. The project is designed as an educational resource for understanding deep learning concepts, particularly in the field of sequence modeling.

## Features

- Character-level language modeling
- Implemented from scratch using Python and PyTorch
- Uses a simple dataset (e.g., names) to train models
- Explores neural network architectures such as multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and transformers

## Author
